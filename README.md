# Sentiment-Analysis-on-customer-reviews
Sentiment analysis on amazon customer reviews for smartphones. A dataset from an online website was taken that contains around thirty thousand  instances. Sentiment analysis and performance rates were measured for the dataset taken.
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS were made on the dataset.
Classification models such as SVM,RANDOM FOREST,LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND NAIVE BAYE'S were used.
Performance accuracies were above 90% for all the classification models

FUTURE WORKS:
• Deep Learning models have made advances in NLP in terms of Sentiment Analysis.
• Such as LSTM,CNN models can be deployed in the future to predict the Sentiment analysis.
